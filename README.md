# React Sorting Visualizer
This project is the React version of my traditional sorting algorithm visualization project. With this project, I used React, a popular JavaScript framework to visualize the differences in the bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap sorting algorithms. You can view this project [here](https://daniel-hinz.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer-React/).

### Installation
The user is able download and run this application by navigating to the directory they wish to download it and running the following commands:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-Hinz/Sorting-Visualizer-React.git
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage
The appliaction offers functionality to visualize the bubble, selection, insertion, merge, quick, and heap sorting algorithms. The user can visualize these by selecting the desired algorithm in the top right of the page and then selecting the 'sort' button located at the bottom of the page. In addition, the user is able to resize the array and modify the speed the algorithm runs.
